# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Beginner-Project
A very simple project to build on my programming and python knowledge. Original code design by Tim Ruscica, with minor alterations to strings. 

The game allows players to compete against the computer in the classic Rock Paper Scissors contest.

How to Use:
Download the Program File:

Click the "Code" button above and select "Download ZIP."
Extract the downloaded ZIP file to a location on your computer.
Open a Terminal Window:

For Windows users, press "Win + R," type "cmd," and press Enter.
For Linux users, search for "Terminal" in System Applications, or use "Ctrl + Alt + T."
Navigate to the File Directory:

Use the cd command to navigate to the location where you extracted the program files.
Run the Program:

Type python rock_paper_scissors.py and press Enter to start the game.
Play the Game:

Follow the on-screen instructions to play Rock Paper Scissors against the computer.
Game Rules:
The player is prompted to choose between Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
The computer randomly selects its move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
The winner is determined based on the classic Rock Paper Scissors rules:
Rock crushes Scissors
Scissors cuts Paper
Paper covers Rock
The game continues until the player chooses to quit, at which point they'll receive a tally of how many times they won vs. the computer. 

Contributions:
Contributions and suggested improvements to this game are welcome! If you have ideas for enhancing the gameplay, adding new features, or improving the code, feel free to submit a pull request. Again, the original code for this file is based off Tim Ruscica's mini python project. 

Enjoy the Game!
Have fun playing Rock Paper Scissors against the computer! Test your luck and see if you can outsmart the machine
